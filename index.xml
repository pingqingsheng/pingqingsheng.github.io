      <description>Rcpp  is package with which you could write c++ code within R.You could simply write a inline C++ code in R like this:
library(Rcpp)# Define a Rcpp functionadd_vec &amp;lt;- Rcpp::cppFunction(&amp;#39;Rcpp::NumericVector add_vec( Rcpp::NumericVector a, Rcpp::NumericVector b){return a+b;}&amp;#39;)# See the resultt(add_vec(c(1,2,3), c(2,3,4)))Or you could save your  .cpp  file and call the function from R. With this powerful tool, you gain the productivity of R and the speed of C++.</description>

      <description>INLAMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a widely used algorithm to sample from posterior distribution that is not in closed form. The draw back of MCMC is that it is usually computationally intensive and its convergence is hard to verify. Integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, original paper could be found at : https://folk.ntnu.no/hrue/r-inla.org/papers/inla-rss.pdf) is algorithm that , instead of sampling from posterior, try to analytically approximate the posterior. This method could be applied to a large collection of Bayesian model, and itâ€™s usually many times faster and provide reasonable accuracy.</description>

      <description>A STAT graduate student trying to earn a living with his superficial knowledge. If you have ever heard &#34;dark forest&#34; theory , you&#39;ll understand why I don&#39;t use my real name. Providing your personal information online is like holding a torch in a dark forest. You&#39;ll never know the reaction of things around you. So be careful...... </description>
